Chattertots is run by [Louise Hibbert](/louise), a speech and language therapist with over 20 years experience.

We provide assessment and treatment for a wide range of speech, language and communication difficulties in children typically preschool and primary age up to around 11 years.  These include speech sound delay, speech sound disorder, dyspraxia, cleft lip/palate, language delay, language disorder, stammering, Downâ€™s Syndrome, global developmental delay, cerebral palsy.   

Where possible we can visit you at home for an initial assessment covering areas around Godalming such as Witley, Chiddingfold, Haslemere, Hindhead, Elstead, Farnham, Ash, Worplesdon, Guildford, Shalford, Chilworth, Shere, Cranleigh and surrounding areas in West Surrey and parts of North-East Hampshire.  Early years therapy sessions are typically offered in her home-based clinic in Godalming as much as possible. We also travel to schools and nurseries in the local area.  

Louise has been the in-house Speech and Language Therapist at Acorns Nursery in Shackleford for many years now and also has close links with St. Hilarys school in Godalming.  She has a particular interest in speech delay/disorder and hearing difficulties.
