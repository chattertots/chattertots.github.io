Chattertots is run by [Louise Hibbert](/louise), a speech and language therapist with over 20 years experience.  She worked for several years living in London and working for the NHS running busy early years community clinics, in Special Schools and mainstream units.  Chattertots Speech and Language Therapy was set up in 2006 when she and her husband moved from London to Godalming and she was expecting her first child.  Another child followed a couple of years later and Louise has been able to manage following her career whilst fitting it around being there for her small (and now not quite so small!) children.  At the beginning this was just one day a week, now it is virtually a full working week with additional team members [Alison](/alison) and [Stephen](/stephen).

We provide assessment and treatment for a wide range of speech, language and communication difficulties in children typically preschool and primary age up to around 11 years.  These include speech sound delay, speech sound disorder, dyspraxia, cleft lip/palate, language delay, language disorder, stammering, Downâ€™s Syndrome, global developmental delay, cerebral palsy.   

Where possible we can visit you at home for an initial assessment covering areas around Godalming such as Witley, Chiddingfold, Haslemere, Hindhead, Elstead, Farnham, Ash, Worplesdon, Guildford, Shalford, Chilworth, Shere, Cranleigh and surrounding areas in West Surrey and parts of North-East Hampshire.  Early years therapy sessions are typically offered in her home-based clinic in Godalming as much as possible. We also travel to schools and nurseries in the local area.  

Louise has been the in-house Speech and Language Therapist at Acorns Nursery in Shackleford for many years now and also has close links with St. Hilarys school in Godalming.  She has a particular interest in speech delay/disorder and hearing difficulties.
