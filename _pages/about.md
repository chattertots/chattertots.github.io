## Louise Hibbert
Louise is a fully qualified, specialist Speech and Language Therapist with over 18 years experience.  She worked for several years living in London and working for the NHS running busy early years community clinics, in Special Schools and mainstream units.  She chose to set up Chattertots Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 when she and her husband moved from London to Godalming and she was expecting her first child.  Another child followed a couple of years later and Louise has been able to manage following her career whilst fitting it around being there for her small (and now not quite so small!) children.  shen the beginning this was just one day a week, now it is virtually a full working week with an additional team member, Alison.

Louise provides assessment and treatment for a wide range of speech, language and communication difficulties in children typically preschool and primary age up to around 8-10 years.  These include speech sound delay, speech sound disorder, dyspraxia, cleft lip/palate, language delay, language disorder, stammering, Downâ€™s Syndrome, global developmental delay, cerebral palsy.   She has a particular interest in speech delay/disorder and hearing difficulties.  

Louise tries when she can to visit you at home for an initial assessment covering areas around Godalming such as Witley, Chiddingfold, Haslemere, Hindhead, Elstead, Farnham, Ash, Worplesdon, Guildford, Shalford, Chilworth, Shere, Cranleigh and surrounding areas in West Surrey and parts of North-East Hampshire.  Early years therapy sessions are typically offered in her home-based clinic in Godalming as much as possible. Louise also travels to schools and nurseries in the local area.  She has been the in-house Speech and Language Therapist at Acorns Nursery in Shackleford for many years now and also has close links with St. Hilarys school in Godalming.

## Alison Taylor
Alison qualified from Reading University in 2004. She worked for nearly 7 years in the NHS during which time she developed skills and experience in a range of special schools/units and community clinics. Since having her own children she has worked independently.  

Alison provides assessment, advice and therapy for children with a range of speech, language and communication difficulties including speech delay/disorder, difficulties understanding language, difficulties using vocabulary and formulating sentences. She loves working with children and helping them progress and succeed in a way they find fun and motivating.

Alison always aims to work closely and flexibly with families, educational staff and any other professionals working with the child. Alison maintains her professional skills and development through regular supervision with colleagues, training courses and current research.

Alison has joined Louise to work collaboratively for Chattertots Speech and Language Therapy, working with children in their homes or educational settings. Alison is able to cover areas slightly more north of Guildford such as parts of Woking.
