## Contracts

If you verbally commit to a speech and language therapy sessions, you are agreeing to accept the terms and conditions below. Please read them carefully and do not hesitate to ask any questions that may arise from them.

## Cancellations

24 hours notice is required.  We reserve the right to charge the full session fee for sessions cancelled by you after this time, or not attended. This includes sessions cancelled because of illness although we may waive this fee for the first late cancellation due to illness in a 6 week block. If your therapist is ill we will offer a replacement session.

## Location of sessions

Assessments may take place at my home-based clinic at GU8 4DF, or may be offered in your own home. We would ask that you provide a quiet environment, free from distraction (e.g. phone, TV) where possible. It is also expected that you will stay with your child for the duration of the session. Unless otherwise arranged, therapy sessions will be provided at my premises in Godalming, Surrey.

It may also be possible to arrange assessment at another location, such as school.

## Geographical area covered

Time permitting, we are willing to provide assessments, and possibly some therapy sessions, to homes within a 10 mile radius of Godalming, Surrey. This covers GU postcodes in most of west Surrey, and parts of north east Hampshire.  However there will be an additional fee for travel time if We travel to a location that is further than 15 minutes away from GU8 4DF or from the Stoughton area of Guildford if you are being seen by Alison.  The travel time fee will apply to the additional travel time beyond the first 15 minutes and will be a portion of my hourly rate of £65 per hour.

## Working hours

Louise provide sessions usually between 9.30am and 3.30pm on a Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday with the last session starting no later than 2.30pm.  

Alison provides sessions between 9am and 5.30pm on a Wednesday and may consider a weekend.  

If you wish to discuss the possibility of arranging sessions outside these hours, please [contact me](tel:+441483389949).

## Role of the parent/carer

During a child's block of therapy, we usually provide tasks for you to carry out with your child for short times between therapy sessions. Completion of these tasks is as important as the therapy sessions themselves, and regular home support usually results in more positive outcomes.

It is therefore essential that you commit to attending all the agreed therapy sessions where possible, to ensuring that an adult consistently attends with your child, and to carrying out the tasks provided, and modelled by us.

## Services and Fees

All fees include administrative tasks outside the contact time with you and your child, e.g. liaison, paperwork, session planning, preparation of resources and also the cost of materials provided.

If you commit to speech and language therapy assessment, you will be asked to make a payment on the first day of assessment. This cost will cover up to an hour and a half face-to-face time with the therapist, include taking a detailed case history about your child and his/her development, assessment of speech, language and communication skills, and a brief written summary report discussing your child's speech and language development, highlighting areas of concern, and informing you of my recommendations. These recommendations may include therapy sessions, however you do not have to commit to these with myself unless you choose to.

Sometimes additional assessment is required.  This may take the form of a detailed standardised assessment during our initial meeting or continued at subsequent sessions.  Since these take considerable time to analyse and score, there may be an additional fee for that time.  It is also likely that your initial report will be longer and more complex, so there would be an additional fee for the extra time too.  

If recommendations include onward referrals (for example to a paediatrician), this may require you to ask your GP to make the referral on your behalf.

If you choose to take up therapy sessions with myself, it is usually appropriate to offer therapy in 'blocks' of 6-8 sessions, followed by a short break of around 8 weeks and then a review. You will be invoiced for therapy sessions at the end of each month by email.  We ask that you pay your invoice within 1 week of receiving it.  Assessment and therapy sessions provided by Alison will still be invoiced by Louise.

## Home programmes

At times it will be appropriate to provide a home programme, for example, following a block of therapy, or a review appointment. Home programmes contain activities and advice for you to use with your child. Costs for home programmes range in price from £10-£65, dependent on the amount of planning required to devise the programme.  Please be aware that we can involve considerable workload to collate resources and write a programme for your child.  

## Failed payments

If a session is not paid for by the day of the appointment or at least by the date on your invoice (usually 7 days later), we may suspend further sessions until payment has been made. You will be sent one further reminder after which payment must be received if debt collection proceedings are to be avoided.
