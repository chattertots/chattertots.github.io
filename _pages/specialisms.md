These are techniques or services that can only be used by a Speech and Language Therapist once they have undergone specific training. 


## PROMPT 

[Louise](/louise) was lucky enough to be part of the first group of Speech and Language Therapists to become PROMPT trained in the UK.  I currently hold a level 2 qualification called ‘Bridging’ which means I have attended the basic training and also the more advanced training.   


PROMPT stands for Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets and on the surface is a ‘hands-on’ approach in which we touch your child’s face and upper body using certain cues to help to shape and move their muscles for speech and to provide kinetic feedback to their sensory/muscular system.  The PROMPT system is far more than just a system of tactile cues though and involves a particular way of observing and analysing your child’s speech production and motor control.  It is also takes into account all areas of their developing system and how this is contributing to their speech and language.  You can find more information at the [Prompt Institute website](https://promptinstitute.com/page/Families_What_is_PROMPT)


## LIDCOMBE 

This is a specific technique used to treat stammering in young children between around 3-8 years.  It is a technique which treats the stammering quite directly but in a very positive way through praise and empowerment.  It is quite a commitment as approximately weekly sessions are required until your child’s stammering has reduced to a certain level.  Then we can move onto a ‘maintenance’ phase.  The length of the initial phase depends on your child and your level of commitment to home practice but it likely to be at least around 8-12 weeks.  You can find more information at the [Lidcombe website](https://www.lidcombeprogram.org/about-lidcombe-program/about-the-lidcombe-program/) 


## JOHANSEN Individualised Auditory Stimulation.   

This technique is not specifically offered by only Speech and Language Therapists but it is very relevant to what we do.  It involves listening to specific pieces of music which have been devised to contain certain sound frequencies.  This is used to bombard your child’s auditory system with input which encourages and strengthens connections within the brain.  This can help speed up your child’s processing and enable them to make the most of their learning environment.  Clients report very fast improvements all sorts of areas including behaviour, attention, retention of information, confidence, and even physical skills.  It is useful for everybody, but is particularly useful for children who have a history of hearing issues, including glue ear, or seem to be struggling a bit at school and falling between the cracks.  They must be able to tolerate wearing headphones, but they can also listen whilst asleep if that is an issue.  You can find more information at the [Johansen website](https://johansenias.com/)


There is no extra fee for using any of these techniques but it is just something that I am able to include in my therapy.  The only additional fee is for the Johansen IAS CDs which I will order for you.  The cost of each CD is £35.   These techniques can only be accessed through Chatterots at the current time.
