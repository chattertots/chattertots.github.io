## Education
**I completed my undergraduate degree in Linguistics in 1997**.  
I then qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001, obtaining a Master of Medical Science (MMedSci) degree in Clinical Communication Studies from the University of Sheffield. I am now a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice, and am registered with the Health Care Professionals council.	            

## Experience
**Prior to working independently I worked within the NHS assessing and treating pre-school and primary-aged children.** 
I have worked in community clinics gaining experience in a broad range of speech, language and communication difficulties and also have experience working in special schools with children with a range of mild to severe learning and physical difficulties.
