Before committing to an assessment, you are welcome to contact me by phone or by email for a brief discussion of your concerns, and whether Speech and Language Therapy could help.  There is no fee for general emails and telephone calls. 


## Initial assessment 
**Time : 1 – 1 ½ hour per session**
**Cost : £140**

This includes taking a detailed case history about your child and his/her development, assessment of speech, language and communication skills and a written summary report.  Travel included up to 15 minutes from therapists base. 

Some cases may require more than one assessment session, depending on your areas of concern, and your child’s attention span.  Should this be the case, additional assessment sessions will be charged at the hourly rate.

## Standard therapy/review/teletherapy appointment at therapist’s base
**Time : (approx) 40 mins**
**Cost : £55**

Each therapy session is individually tailored to your child’s needs and progress.  Fee includes preparation time, materials used in session, casenote writing and setting weekly homework.

## Standard therapy/review appointment at child’s home/school/nursery
**Time : (approx) 30 mins**
**Cost : £65**

Each therapy session is individually tailored to your child’s needs and progress.  Fee includes preparation time, materials used in session, casenote writing and setting weekly homework. Fee also includes travel up to 15 mins from therapist’s base and very brief liaison with school staff.

## Long therapy/review/teletherapy appointment at therapist’s base
**Time : (approx) 1 hour**
**Cost : £65**

A longer session is required initially for techniques such as PCI or Lidcome.

## Additional or longer written reports
**Time : per hour**
**Cost : £65**

This applies if more than a summary report is desired following an assessment (additional time will be added to the assessment fee). It is often beneficial to produce a report at the end of therapy and/or following a review appointment, not only to keep for records, but also as a progress update for other medical or educational staff involved with your child (with parental consent). This fee will also be applied if you ask for a progress/information email. 

## Home programme
**Time : per hour**
**Cost : £65**

It is sometimes appropriate to provide a programme of activities to be carried out at home over a number of weeks or months.  For example this may be the case when therapy is not immediately appropriate or at the end of a block of therapy before a review. Please note the price for this can vary as it can take considerable time to collate and make resources.
