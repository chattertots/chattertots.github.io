Alison qualified from Reading University in 2004. She worked for nearly 7 years in the NHS during which time she developed skills and experience in a range of special schools/units and community clinics. Since having her own children she has worked independently.  

Alison provides assessment, advice and therapy for children with a range of speech, language and communication difficulties including speech delay/disorder, difficulties understanding language, difficulties using vocabulary and formulating sentences. She loves working with children and helping them progress and succeed in a way they find fun and motivating.

Alison always aims to work closely and flexibly with families, educational staff and any other professionals working with the child. Alison maintains her professional skills and development through regular supervision with colleagues, training courses and current research.

Alison has joined Louise to work collaboratively for Chattertots Speech and Language Therapy, working with children in their homes or educational settings. Alison is able to cover areas slightly more north of Guildford such as parts of Woking.
